## Architecture
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR): 
> The initial rendering of the web page, including the game board and initial game state, is performed on the server (using Flask in this case). The server generates the HTML content and sends it to the client when the user first accesses the page or performs a page refresh.

- Client-Side Interactivity: 
> After the initial rendering, client-side JavaScript takes over to handle user interactions and dynamic updates. For example, when a user make a move i then make a fetch request to the http server requesting a computer move
